 Dynamic Deadline Automation using Asana API

 Overview
This project automates due date assignment and updates in Asana tasks based on their priority levels and status changes. Specifically:
1. Assigns a due date to tasks automatically based on priority levels:  
    Low: 14 days  
    Mid: 7 days  
    High: 2 days  
2. Automatically extends due dates for other "In Progress" tasks when a High Priority task is moved to In Progress.  



 Prerequisites

1. Python Installation:  
   Ensure Python 3.7 or later is installed on your system.  
   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Install Dependencies:  
   Install required libraries using the following command:  
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Asana API Token:  
    Generate an Asana API token by logging into Asana and navigating to your account settings under the Apps tab.  
    Update the `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the script with your token.

4. Project and Task IDs:  
    Identify a valid Asana Project ID and Task IDs within your workspace.  
    Update the script with appropriate `TASK_ID` and `PROJECT_ID`.



 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourRepoName/DynamicDeadlineAutomation.git
   cd DynamicDeadlineAutomation
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Update the `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `TASK_ID`, and `PROJECT_ID` in the script with your Asana credentials and IDs.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python dynamic_deadline.py
   ```



 Usage Instructions
1. Initial Due Date Assignment  
    The script will assign a due date based on task priority:
      `Low`: 14 days from the current date.
      `Mid`: 7 days from the current date.
      `High`: 2 days from the current date.

2. High Priority Task Movement  
    If a High Priority task is moved to In Progress:
      All other tasks in In Progress will have their due dates extended by 2 days.



 Example Input
In the script:
 Replace the placeholders with real values:
  ```python
  TASK_ID = "your_task_id_here"   Example: "1208826928587395"
  PROJECT_ID = "your_project_id_here"   Example: "1208826931765461"
  PRIORITY_LEVEL = "High"   Options: Low, Mid, High
  ```



 Expected Output
 The script will output updates for task due dates in the console. For example:
  ```plaintext
  Task 1208826928587395 updated with due date: 20241124
  Task 1208826928581234 updated with due date: 20241126
  ```



 Troubleshooting
1. Invalid Project ID:  
   Ensure the `PROJECT_ID` exists in your Asana workspace. Use the verify project function in the script to confirm its validity.

2. API Token Errors:  
   Ensure your API token is valid and has sufficient permissions for the workspace.
